# 👋 Hey there!

I'm **Gabry**, an Italian Computer Science student based in Rome 🇮🇹 with a passion for Linux, open source and all things hackable. I spend most of my time messing with systems I probably shouldn't touch and pretending to get enough sleep (spoiler: I don't).

## 🧠 About Me

- 💻 Daily driving **Arch Linux** (btw) with **KDE Plasma**  
- 🧩 Fascinated by modding: CFWs, Android rooting, iOS jailbreaks – you name it  
- ⚙️ Love getting my hands dirty with **Proxmox**, **Debian**, and **Ubuntu Server**  
- 📡 Interested in networking, server management, and system-level stuff  
- 🧑‍💻 I mostly code in **Python**, **Go**, **Java**, and **C**  
- 💬 Also into crypto, Vocaloid music, indie & Nintendo games, anime and solving Sudoku puzzles at 3AM

> _"the voices are saying that 15 hours of sleep are not enough"_

## 🔧 Projects & Things I Like
I'm not (yet) building the next Linux kernel, but I like contributing to personal or community-driven projects, especially those that:
- Are FOSS and *actually useful*
- Let me learn how things work *under the hood*
- Involve breaking stuff on purpose to figure it out
